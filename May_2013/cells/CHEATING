Some proposed ground rules:

- No module-level or other shared state in "mind" modules. Agent state
  must be visible to only a single AgentMind object.

- The act method may only access game state passed to it in its
  arguments. This current includes a WorldView and a MessageQueue.

- Only interact with a MessageQueue through its send_message and
  get_messages methods. Do not call update and do not attempt to
  interact with its internal state.
