#  Overall rules:
#  Agents at plants reproduce as much as possible
#  Agents are born with a random direction away from the plant
#  Agents send a message with they attack
#  Agents always attack
#  Agents goto the location of the attack, exception scouts that keep looking
#
#  Results
#  Large growing swarm that explores that area for all plants as fast as possible
#  until the enemy is found.  By the time the enemy is found everyone is spread out
#  Once the enemy is found everyone heads in that direction and if there are any
#  plants between the two they are usually taken before they enemy.
#  Once a new plant is reached more are quickly spawned and that plant is overrun
#  From there it is simple attrition
